## Portals
**SLEEPCHART**: All results and sleep GWAS summary statistics are publicly disseminated at our SleepChart portal: https://labs-laboratory.com/sleepchart/

**MEDICINE**: BAG GWAS summary statistics are publicly disseminated at our MEDICINE portal: https://labs-laboratory.com/medicine/

## Data
Because our primary analyses used UK Biobank data, we cannot publicly share any individual-level information, including sleep duration measures and the 23 biological aging clocks. Instead, we provide an analysis script that users can adapt by supplying their own approved UK Biobank CSV/TSV inputs. Data sources beyond the UK Biobank may be obtained through researcher application processes to respective studies (e.g., the NIA-supported BLSA) or are publicly available for download (e.g., FinnGen and PGC GWAS summary statistics). All relevant information is detailed in the **Data Availability** and **Code Availability** sections of the manuscript.
